I do not own or have permission to publish this app since it's a duplicate
of Apple's iOS calculator.  This project is for strictly educational in nature
to demonstrate how to build an iOS app as well as for entertainment purposes 
since the calculator only sort of works.

Feel free to do what you want with my code, but recognize that I don not have
permission to publish this and you probably don't either.
